## Education
I was born in Tehran, Iran and spent most of my teenage years in Norman, Oklahoma where I finished my undergraduate studies at the University of Oklahoma in 2012. As an undergraduate researcher, I became very interested in mechanics. Over the years, my research interests have constantly evolved and diversified. However, mechanics and physics of solids remain at the core of my endeavors.
