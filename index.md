Our work is the first to map and reveal the importance of 3D out-of-plane stresses in cellular layers. Moreover, our findings on the distinct roles of topological defects and disclinations provide a unique perspective on how through collective self-organization, cells exploit mechanical and physical constraints to switch between different modes of cell elimination. Additionally, the framework presented herein allows for independent tuning of cell-cell and cell-substrate interaction forces, that is unprecedented in studying collective cell behavior and as such is expected to open the door to a new set of questions in mechanobiology.

The results contribute to the increasing realization of the importance of the mechanical properties of cells in controlling their behavior, and we hope that they will be of interest to a broad range of mathematicians, biophysicists and cell biologists interested in connecting the physics of cellular self-organization to the dynamics of biological systems.
