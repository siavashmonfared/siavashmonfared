This paper advances understanding on confined fluid behavior in (dis)ordered granular aggregates and their inverse porous structures. For the first time, we unravel the link between surface-surface correlations to the degree of confinement while addressing long-standing questions on the first-order nature of liquid-gas phase transition and whether capillary critical temperature represents a true critical temperature. This is done via access to capillary pressure fields and a finite size scaling analysis that maps the studied systems onto the Random Field Ising Model universality class as conjectured by F. Brochard and P.G. de Gennes. We link the underlying random fields to disorder in local fluid-solid interactions.

These findings have significance for both applied fields, such as pore size characterization and carbon capture, to theoretical fields, including glass physics, wet granular physics and physics of confined fluids.
