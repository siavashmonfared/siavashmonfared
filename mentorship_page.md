### Mentor, The Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowships (SURF) , Caltech

As a postdoctoral scholar, I have and continue to mentor students participating in Caltech's flagship undergraduate research program, SURF. Here are some examples of the projects that we have explored together: 

- Jade Leong (University of Massachusetts Lowell) - [Mechanical behavior of entangled, non-convex granular particles: experimental analysis of the angle of repose](/pdf/Jade_Leong_SURF_Final_Presentation.pdf).
- Katheryn Wang (Harvey Mudd College) - [Uniaxial compression of discrete S shaped particles](/pdf/Katheryn_Wang_Final_Presentation.pdf).
- Sydney Richardson (California Institute of Technology) - [Tensile behavior of entangled non-convex granular particles](/pdf/Sydney_Richardson_Final_Presentation.pdf).
- Animesh Rastogi (Indian Institute of Technology Gandhinagar) - [Pluviation simulation and angle of repose of entangled granular materials](/pdf/Animesh_Final_Presentation.pdf).
- Omkar Devidas Kadam (Indian Institute of Technology Gandhinagar) - [Exploring the properties of free standing column built out of designed granular particles using level-set discrete element method](/pdf/SURF_presentation_Omkar.pdf).
- Graciela Lopez (University of Costa Rica) - [Influence of slenderness on the bearing capacity of a confined granular column](/pdf/SURF_presentation_Omkar.pdf).
- Utkarsh Gupta (Indian Institute of Technology Delhi) - [Granular Material In-Fill Inside a Confining Annulus](/pdf/SURF_presentation_Omkar.pdf).

### Resident Tutor, Cabot Undergraduate House, Harvard University 

While a graduate student at MIT, for two years I resided in Cabot House, an undergraduate residence at Harvard University, as Resident Tutor among 400 undergraduates. I primarily interacted with students pursuing STEM related concentrations, advised them on academic and non-academic STEM career paths, assisted them on graduate school applications, scholarships, fellowships, research internships and tutored them on their math, physics and engineering courses among other things

### Tutor, Multicultural Engineering Program, College of Engineering, University of Oklahoma

As an undergraduate scholar in Multicultural Engineering Program, the flagship program at University of Oklahoma's College of Engineering for diversity and inclusion, I tutored & mentored a number of students in variety of math, physics, and engineering subjects.
